1)Create a trigger to ensure that no employee of less that 25 can be inserted in the database.
=>	create table employee_backup (employee_id number, salary number);
      
      --drop table employee_backup; //
      --select * from employee_backup; //
      
      --select * from emp; //
      
      create or replace trigger backupp before delete on emp
      for each row
      begin
      insert into employee_backup values(:old.employee_id,:old.salary);
      end;
      
      
      delete from emp where employee_id = 102;
	  
	  
	  
2) create a trigger which will work before deletion in employee table and create a duplicate copy the record in another table employee_backup.
=>	insert into employee1 values(100,'geetha',30,20000);
	insert into employee1 values(101,'pooja',38,22000);
	insert into employee1 values(102,'abi',40,26000);

	select * from employee1;

	create or replace trigger before_age
	before insert on employee1
	for each row
	begin
	if (:new.age < 25) then 
	raise_application_error(-20000,'ERROR!! THE AGE MUST BE ATLEAST 25');
	end if;
	end;
	/

	--insert into employee1 values(103,'kavya',26,21000);

	select * from employee1
